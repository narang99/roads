# Segmentation of small objects

this is actually not quite bad. Although segmentation takes a lot of compute and thus its hard for me to experiment a lot.  
It might be better to setup a simple experiment notebook which keeps running my experiments. Colab takes too long for testing though.  

I made a mistake by not checking my extraction code for data synthesis before training the model. From now on, always create functions to verify how the data looks after extraction.
