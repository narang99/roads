# Same as 004 but on gradient


bThe morphological gradient draws nice borders around garbage. I'm going to repeat the experiment from section 4, training an HTI classifier on small segments. I'll first apply a morphological gradient operation to the input image, then train the classifier on those small segments.   

It is pointing to everything now, bad results. Can i run morphology first and then see? Does it make a differnece? If i run it before resize or after?: This is even worse. Finds a lot of stuff. I'm not sure if I should go in this direction.
