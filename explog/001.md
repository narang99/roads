# Train on labelled data

- I trained the model on self-labelled data. The problem right now is defining what garbage is.  
- I settled on using every piece of garbage as a label. But that turned out very hard to label in practice.  
- So I ended up labelling only big pieces of garbage. But what is big? That is again hard to define. 
- This ended up giving non-objective labels. I still tried to train the model on these labels but it did not work out.  
- The model started gaming since there were a lot of negative samples. It basically never drew a box to minimise loss.  
- Decreased the amount of negative samples. The model still did not learn to make boxes. The amount of data I have is very less (this is an assumption).  
- The only piece of useful observation was the garbage is pretty much bright objects in a neutral background.
