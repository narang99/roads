# Synthetic data: T1

- Garbage is bright objects on neutral background.  
- We take out fragments of garbage and copy paste it on images for synthetic data generation.  
- I first take out a bunch of fragments from existing data from label studio.  
- From these crops, I need the fragment without background
  - Used basic thresholding, morphology and cropping. This is generally useful in finding trash which is quite bright.  
  - This is not useful when the fragment itself is very similar to its background, there are many fragments like this
  - A lot of street level images have garbage farther down the road, these fragments are missed
- Generate synthetic data from bright fragments by randomly copy pasting, without scaling.  
- The model had good accuracy on synthetic data. But it again did not work well on real data.  


## Behavior of real data

- It generally was not sure of anything. This might be a problem of me having synthetic data. But since I'm making a baseline model, I keep a low threshold.  
- It would mark rear view mirrors as garbage
- Some tree leaves
- It would also mark stuff as garbage if it is in front of it. Many times.  


A problem right now is that fragments look big I feel, compared to the actual fragments. I need a bunch of images and need to recreate that kind of garbage more faithfully.
