# segmentation smallnet, v2

The goal is to uncenter the data, the prepared data has everything centered

On closer inspection, I see that I have a bug in my extraction code lol.  

Two kinds of cropping I can do. The first crop engulfs the whole object; the other crop cuts through it, showing a portion of the object at the corner of the crop.

I’ve written the corner‑cut version, but I’ll start with the engulfing one only. I’ve seen the cropping logic in engulf, which places the object in random positions, giving it a higher probability of appearing on random sides or corners of the crop. 

I accidentally added both cuts and engulfs. model has bad performance in cuts (expected i feel, not enough information). Gnona do only on engulfs also now. 

Model seems to have good performance for engulfed only. Its not doing well if the garbage piece is
- fully covering the tile
- is small compared to the tile
- big tile size (I feel this is more about not enough garbage ,and me not training for big tile size, i should do that too)

## Cropping v3
- Add support for minimum padding (so that we have a bigger picture with small garbage inside)

Crop types
- in different corners ✅
- large padding ❌
- very small padding ❌
