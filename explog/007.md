The goal is to uncenter the data, the prepared data has everything centered

On closer inspection, I see that I have a bug in my extraction code lol.  

Two kinds of cropping I can do. The first crop engulfs the whole object; the other crop cuts through it, showing a portion of the object at the corner of the crop.

I’ve written the corner‑cut version, but I’ll start with the engulfing one only. I’ve seen the cropping logic in engulf, which places the object in random positions, giving it a higher probability of appearing on random sides or corners of the crop.
